**Setting up Environment Variables**

Once you have your host setup, you'll notice the frontend cannot deploy without some basic environment variables. You'll need to configure these environment variables inside your web-hosting provider.

Usually they will have an interface where you can paste your environment variables. See `env.example` to see the schema for your environment variables.

> Please note, you will need to include all environment variables for this site to function properly.
